# CPU

Alternately referred to as a processor, central processor, or microprocessor, the CPU (pronounced sea-pea-you) is the central processing unit of the computer. A computer's CPU handles all instructions it receives from hardware and software running on the computer.

The picture below is an example of what the top and bottom of an Intel Pentium processor may look. The processor is placed and secured into a compatible CPU socket found on the motherboard. Processors produce heat, so they are covered with a heat sink to keep them cool and running smoothly.

As seen in the picture above, the CPU chip is usually square with one notched corner to help make sure it's properly inserted into the CPU socket. On the bottom of the chip are hundreds of connector pins that plug into each of the corresponding holes in the socket. Today, most CPU's resemble the picture shown above. However, Intel and AMD have also experimented with slot processors that were much larger and slid into a slot on the motherboard. Also, over the years, there have been dozens of different types of sockets on motherboards. Each socket only supports specific types of processors and each has its own pin layout.

In the CPU, there are two primary components.

1. ALU (arithmetic logic unit) - performs mathematical, logical, and decision operations.
2. CU (control unit) - directs all the processors operations.

## Types

### Intel

#### 8086

Developed by Intel and introduced on June 8, 1978, the 8086 was a microprocessor code-named P1. It used a 16-bit architecture, had 29,000 transistors, ran at clock speeds of 5 MHz to 10 MHz, and could access one megabyte of memory.

> #### x86
> 
> x86 is an Intel CPU architecture that originated with the 16-bit 8086 processor in 1978. Today, the term "x86" is used generally to refer to any 32-bit processor compatible with the x86 instruction set.
> 
> In its 40 years of existence, the x86 architecture has added many new features while remaining almost entirely backward-compatible, which is a remarkable achievement.
> 
> Modern 64-bit processors are generally referred to as x86_64, although they may also be referred to as amd64. The amd64 label is in reference to AMD being at the forefront of 64-bit processing technology in the early 2000s. Regardless of the label, these processors (and the software compiled for them) are based upon, and compatible with, Intel's x86 architecture.

#### Core

The Intel Core is the successor to the Intel Pentium M and was first introduced on January 5, 2006. The Intel Core is the computer processor used with laptop computers.

#### Pentium

Code-named P5, the Intel Pentium was released by Intel on March 22, 1993, as a replacement to the 80486 processor. The name comes from the Greek word for "five" and is used because it's the fifth processor in the 80x86 line.

#### Celeron

In early 1998, Intel was having a hard time selling the Pentium II, which at the time was expensive. Many users bought the AMD K6-233, which offered very good performance at a moderate price. Thus, Intel created a brand new CPU called the Celeron, which is similar to the Pentium II, but lacks L2 cache, the Pentium II shell, and uses a new Covington core.

#### Xeon

The Xeon is a high-end Intel processor for enterprise servers and workstations that runs on compatible Xeon motherboards.

#### Atom 

The Intel Atom is a family of low-power computer processors specifically designed for mobile devices that are developed by Intel and was first announced on March 2, 2008.

#### XScale

Introduced in April 2004, the Intel XScale is a family of processors for mobile devices such as PDAs and smartphones.

### AMD

#### Ryzen

Ryzen is a line of CPUs designed by AMD, first released in February 2017. Ryzen CPUs operate on the Zen microarchitecture and use the AM4 socket type.

The Ryzen line is a direct competitor to Intel Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 processors, designed for high-end gaming, video editing and broadcasting, and general productivity.

#### Athlon

Popular computer processor from AMD that has a 266 MHz front-side bus, support for PC2100 DDR memory, and runs at speeds of 1 GHz to 1.33 GHz.

## Key indicators

### Instruction set

The instruction set, also called ISA (instruction set architecture), is part of a computer that pertains to programming, which is basically machine language. The instruction set provides commands to the processor, to tell it what it needs to do. The instruction set consists of addressing modes, instructions, native data types, registers, memory architecture, interrupt, and exception handling, and external I/O.

> #### CISC
> 
> Short for complex instruction set computer, CISC is currently the standard in the majority of PCs today that supports as many as two hundred instructions. CISC chips use many techniques formerly associated only with RISC chips.
> 
> 
> #### RISC
> 
> Developed and introduced by IBM in 1980, and coined by David Patterson, RISC is short for reduced instruction set computing. It is pronounced "risk." RISC is a processor architecture that requires less instructions to operate, causing the processors to be faster than earlier CISC processors. Today, RISC and CISC processors share many of the same instruction techniques and operate at similar speeds.

### Clock frequency

Clock frequency refers to the processor's operational clock cycles per second. The frequency of most modern CPUs is measured in GHz, or billions of cycles per second.

The speed of a computer processor, or CPU, is determined by the clock cycle, which is the amount of time between two pulses of an oscillator. Generally speaking, the higher number of pulses per second, the faster the computer processor can to process information. The clock speed is measured in Hz, often either megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz). For example, a 4 GHz processor performs 4,000,000,000 clock cycles per second.

Computer processors can execute one or more instructions per clock cycle, depending on the type of processor. Early computer processors and slower CPUs can only execute one instruction per clock cycle, but modern processors can execute multiple instructions per clock cycle.

> #### Overclock
> 
> Sometimes abbreviated as OC, overclock is a method of configuring a computer to perform faster than its advertised speed. Overclocking is accomplished by setting or changing jumpers, dip switches, CMOS settings, firmware updates, or using software utilities. Overclocking allows users to get a performance boost and is most often performed on the computers CPU and video card.
> 
> Overclocking should only be performed by advanced computer users or users aware of its risks. When overclocking a computer, you may experience random errors or lockups related to heat and will void your warranty on the hardware device and possibly the computer or motherboard. Finally, overclocking can sometimes damage and even destroy computer components.

### Cache

Cache is a high-speed access area that can be a reserved section of main memory or on a storage device.

Memory cache is a portion of the high-speed SRAM (static random access memory) and is effective because most programs access the same data or instructions repeatedly. By keeping as much of this information as possible in SRAM, the computer avoids accessing the slower DRAM, making the computer perform faster and more efficiently. Today, most computers come with L3 cache or L2 cache, while older computers included only L1 cache. Below is an example of the Intel i7 processor and its shared L3 cache.

> #### L1 cache
> 
> With computer processors, L1 cache is cache built into the processor that is the fastest and most expensive cache in the computer. The L1 cache stores the most critical files that need to be executed and is the first thing the processor looks when performing an instruction.
> 
> #### L2 cache
> 
> L2 is specialized, high-performance computer memory located on the die of the CPU. Unlike Layer 1 cache, L2 cache was located on the motherboard on earlier computers, although with newer processors it is found on the processor chip. It is located closer to the CPU, and therefore has lower latency, than the L3 cache.This cache is not as fast as the L1 cache, but is only slightly slower since it is still located on the same processor chip, and is still faster than the computers memory. The L2 cache is the second thing the computer looks at when performing instructions.
> 
> #### L3 cahce
> 
> L3 cache is cache memory located on the die of the CPU. The picture of the Intel Core i7-3960X processor die is an example of a processor chip containing six CPU cores and shared L3 cache. The L3 cache is shared between all CPU cores. It is slower, and has greater capacity, than the L1 or L2 cache.

## Technologies

### Pipeline

Alternatively referred to as pipline, piplining is an advanced microprocessing technique capable of handling multiple stages of different computer instructions at one time. Piplining allows for an increase in performance and the overall throughput of the processor.

### Branch prediction

Branch prediction is a technique used in CPU design that attempts to guess the outcome of a conditional operation and prepare for the most likely result. A digital circuit that performs this operation is known as a branch predictor. It is an important component of modern CPU architectures, such as the x86.

When a conditional operation such as an if…else statement needs to be processed, the branch predictor "speculates" what condition is most likely to be met.

### Hyper-Threading

HT (Hyper-Threading) is a technology developed by Intel and introduced with the Xeon processor and later included with the Intel Pentium 4 processor. HT allows the processor to work more efficiently by processing two sets of instructions at the same time, making it look like two logical processors. Also, software written for dual processor computers or multi processor computers are still compatible with HT.

### HyperTransport

Sometimes abbreviated as HT, HyperTransport is an open replacement for the computer FSB, as well as other legacy bridges and buses originally developed by AMD. HyperTransport was code-named LDT (Lightning Data Transfer) and today is used in computers, servers, and other high-performance networking and communications equipment.

## Comment

CPU always develops faster and with higher throughput. But now, traditional single-core performance has gradually approached the physical limit. So multicore and distributed computing have emerged. 

Another trend is making processing to Specialize certain abilities such as TPU and GPU.
